# This file contains @biomejs/biome versions that should not be mirrored.
# This is an escape hatch to work around broken upstream releases.

# Lines beginning with a hash sign (like this one) are ignored.
# Empty lines are ignored.

# Versions SHOULD NOT use `v` prefix, they are NPM package versions (semver).
